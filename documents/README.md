</p>
The SmartDeskClock includes Includes new capabilities such as:

1. **Time and Temperature Display**: The clock will display the time (hours, minutes, seconds) and date on the screen along with the ambient temperature.

2. **Reminders and Notifications**: The clock can set timers, countdowns, reminder, and provide audio and RGB LED notifications when the specified time is reached.

3. **Entertainment**: Users can enjoy playing some simple built-in games on the clock, such as snake game.

4. **Computer Interaction Capability**: Users can interact with the clock through a computer to set the time, and perform firmware updates.
5. **Connect to other Device**: Smart Desk Clock can connect to other available devices for real-time video sharing .
6. Read our [release note](./RELEASE_NOTE.md) for more details and Look forward to other exciting features in the future . 

## Usage
1. Clone the project repository from [GitHub â†—](https://github.com/quynhle-dev/Smart-Desk-Clock-).
2. Set up your development environment with the required IDE (STM32CubeIDE) and toolchain and open the project in the chosen IDE.
3. Read our [diagram](./wire_connection.png) to connect the necessary peripherals or sensors to the STM32 microcontroller.
4. Deploy the firmware to the STM32 microcontroller using the appropriate flashing method (e.g., ST-Link, DFU, or bootloader).
